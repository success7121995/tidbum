**Tidbum**
Tidbum is a dedicated iOS app designed to bring clarity, structure, and personal meaning to your growing photo and video library. While the built-in Photos app supports basic album creation and manual media sorting, it lacks deeper structural organization and scalable tools for managing large collections.

Tidbum addresses these limitations by enabling users to organize media with nested albums, apply custom sorting, and attach captions in a meaningful way — turning a cluttered camera roll into a curated library of memories.

Tidbum is built for users who want more control over how they organize, navigate, and emotionally connect with their media. It provides:
-A hierarchical album system that lets you create albums inside albums
-Full custom sorting of albums and assets
-Captions that stay front and center, so context isn’t lost
-A focused interface built around simplicity and structure

**Key Features**
## Nested Album Support
Create albums within albums to reflect the way you actually think about your media:
-Travel → 2023 → Japan → Kyoto
-Family → Holidays → Christmas → 2021
-Projects → House Renovation → Before / After

## Album and Media Sorting
-Manually via drag-and-drop
Photos and videos within albums can also be sorted or rearranged freely.

## Captions for Context
Add captions to any photo or video. These are:
-Visible during browsing
-Searchable (planned)
-Stored locally alongside your media data
-Captions help you preserve what made a moment meaningful — whether it's who was there, what was happening, or why it mattered.

## Focused, Minimal UI
Tidbum is designed to get out of the way. Its interface is:
-Clean and distraction-free while browsing
-Fully interactive while organizing
-Optimized for both quick glances and deep curation sessions

## Local-Only Data
-Tidbum stores everything — album structure, sorting, and captions — directly on your device using local storage. No internet or cloud account is required.

## Why Tidbum?
This isn’t just another gallery app. Tidbum is built for users who:
-Feel overwhelmed by the flat, disorganized layout of iOS Photos
-Want deeper control over how they structure and relive memories
-Care about the story behind their media — not just the image

Tidbum helps you:
-Rediscover important memories, not just recent ones
-Tell stories visually, by ordering your media with intention
-Organize at scale, without losing clarity or context
